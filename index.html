    <p>On the 3rd of September, in the year 2023, a Saturday, it was a very peaceful day. The temperature had not yet reached 100 degrees. The queue, for access to the river is slow; and hot. Should have reserved our access online. Finally, we are at the front of the line. The local river passes are valid. The guy in the hat and nice button down, light-weight fishing shirt, smiles down at us. Gives us one green wristband; our ride back here. The nice shirt guy in the hat says everything is good and doesn't allow us to pay; doesn't have the girl ring it up. On the river, our own tubes, free of charge. Time to get a drink.</p>

    <p>A few things happen at the bar</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Tara wants a Mojito</li>
      <li>The bartender doesn't have any mint leaves (it's a canister bar)</li>
      <li>He does have fresh limes</li>
      <li>The Margarita made for the birthday girl and her boyfriend is on them</li>
      <li>Tara get's a concoction with mint liqueur as a Mojito</li>
    </ul>
